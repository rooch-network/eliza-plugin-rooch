# eliza-plugin-rooch Product Requirement Document

## 1. Plugin Overview

`eliza-plugin-rooch` is a plugin designed to integrate ElizaOS with the **Rooch Network**. Rooch is a programmable blockchain platform built on Bitcoin, offering high performance and scalability. This plugin enables ElizaOS's AI agents to interact with the Rooch Network, performing token transfers, smart contract invocations, and other operations.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Token Transfer and Wallet Management

- **Description:** Supports sending and receiving tokens on the Rooch Network. The agent should be able to generate, sign, and broadcast transactions to the network.

### 2.2 Smart Contract Interaction

- **Description:** Allows the agent to invoke smart contracts deployed on Rooch, enabling functionalities like asset management and decentralized finance (DeFi) operations.

### 2.3 Wallet Management

- **Description:** Provides wallet creation, import, export, and backup functionalities to ensure secure management of user assets.

### 2.4 Event Listening

- **Description:** Listens for specific events on the Rooch Network, such as transaction confirmations or smart contract events, and triggers corresponding actions by the agent.

### 2.5 Bitcoin Functionality Integration

#### 2.5.1 Bitcoin Asset Query
- **Description:** Supports querying user assets on the Bitcoin network through the Rooch SDK, including UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs) and Inscriptions. The plugin should allow AI agents to query the balance and status of Bitcoin assets for a specified address.
- **Use Case:** Users can query their Bitcoin assets, such as UTXO counts or Inscription status, through AI agents.

#### 2.5.2 Bitcoin State Synchronization
- **Description:** Supports synchronizing Bitcoin network state data to the Rooch Network through the Rooch SDK. The plugin should allow AI agents to access synchronized Bitcoin state data and provide state proof functionality.
- **Use Case:** Developers can verify whether a user owns a specific UTXO or Inscription at a certain block height.

#### 2.5.3 Bitcoin Asset Protocol Extension
- **Description:** Supports extending Bitcoin asset protocols, such as BRC20 and Ordinals, through the Rooch SDK. The plugin should allow AI agents to query asset information based on these protocols.
- **Use Case:** Users can query their Bitcoin assets based on BRC20 or Ordinals protocols through AI agents.

#### 2.5.4 Non-Custodial Bitcoin Asset Migration
- **Description:** Supports non-custodial migration of Bitcoin assets through the Rooch SDK. The plugin should allow AI agents to query the status and related information of asset migrations.
- **Use Case:** Users can query the status of assets migrated between Bitcoin and Rooch networks through AI agents.

### 2.6 Load Character and Memory from Rooch Network

- **Description:** Enables AI agents to load character profiles and memory data stored on the Rooch Network. This functionality allows agents to retrieve and utilize pre-defined character traits, behaviors, and historical interactions stored on-chain.
- **Use Case:** 
  - **Character Loading:** AI agents can load specific character profiles (e.g., personality, preferences, and behavior patterns) from the Rooch Network, enabling consistent and personalized interactions.
  - **Memory Retrieval:** AI agents can access historical interaction data (e.g., past conversations, user preferences, and contextual information) stored on the Rooch Network, enhancing context-aware responses.
- **Technical Implementation:** 
  - Utilize Rooch's smart contract capabilities to store and retrieve character and memory data.
  - Integrate with ElizaOS's memory management system to seamlessly load and utilize on-chain data.

## 3. Technical Requirements

### 3.1 Rooch SDK Integration

- **Description:** Utilize the Rooch SDK or API to implement communication and operations with the Rooch Network.

### 3.2 Security

- **Description:** Ensure all operations meet Web3 security standards to prevent potential vulnerabilities. Refer to ElizaOS's integrated Gogplus security plugin to enhance security.

### 3.3 Performance Optimization

- **Description:** Optimize plugin performance to ensure fast and stable interactions with the Rooch Network.

## 4. Development and Maintenance

### 4.1 Documentation

- **Description:** Provide detailed development documentation, including plugin installation, configuration, usage guides, and examples of interacting with the Rooch Network.

### 4.2 Testing

- **Description:** Conduct comprehensive unit and integration testing to ensure the plugin's stability and reliability.

### 4.3 Community Support

- **Description:** Establish a community for users and developers to gather feedback and continuously improve the plugin's features.

## 5. Compatibility

### 5.1 ElizaOS Version

- **Description:** Ensure the plugin is compatible with the latest version of ElizaOS. Refer to ElizaOS's plugin development guidelines to ensure compatibility and stability.

### 5.2 Rooch Network Version

- **Description:** Ensure compatibility with the latest version of the Rooch Network and adapt to protocol changes in the network.

## 6. Release and Deployment

### 6.1 Version Control

- **Description:** Use platforms like GitHub for version control to manage plugin code, facilitating collaboration and version management.

### 6.2 Release Process

- **Description:** Define a clear release process, including version number management, release notes, and changelogs.
