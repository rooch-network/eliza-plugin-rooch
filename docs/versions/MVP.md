# eliza-plugin-rooch MVP Product Requirement Document

## 1. Plugin Overview

`eliza-plugin-rooch` is a plugin designed to integrate ElizaOS with the **Rooch Network**. Rooch is a programmable blockchain platform built on Bitcoin, offering high performance and scalability. This MVP version focuses on enabling ElizaOS's AI agents to perform token transfers, query Bitcoin assets, and load character profiles from the Rooch Network.

## 2. Functional Requirements (MVP)

### 2.1 Token Transfer and Wallet Management

- **Description:** Supports sending and receiving tokens on the Rooch Network. The agent should be able to generate, sign, and broadcast transactions to the network.
- **Key Features:**
  - Generate and sign transactions for token transfers.
  - Broadcast transactions to the Rooch Network.
  - Query wallet balances for Rooch-based tokens (e.g., RGas).
- **Use Case:** Users can instruct AI agents to transfer tokens between wallets on the Rooch Network.

### 2.2 Bitcoin Asset Query

- **Description:** Supports querying user assets on the Bitcoin network through the Rooch SDK, including UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs) and Inscriptions. The plugin should allow AI agents to query the balance and status of Bitcoin assets for a specified address.
- **Key Features:**
  - Query UTXO balances for a given Bitcoin address.
  - Provide a summary of Bitcoin assets for user reference.
- **Use Case:** Users can query their Bitcoin assets, such as UTXO counts or Inscription status, through AI agents.

### 2.3 Character Loading

### 3.2 Security

- **Description:** Ensure all operations meet Web3 security standards to prevent potential vulnerabilities.
- **Key Tasks:**
  - Implement secure transaction signing and broadcasting.
  - Validate and sanitize user inputs for Bitcoin asset queries.
  - Encrypt sensitive character profile data stored on-chain.

### 3.3 Performance Optimization

- **Description:** Optimize plugin performance to ensure fast and stable interactions with the Rooch Network.
- **Key Tasks:**
  - Minimize latency for token transfers and Bitcoin asset queries.
  - Optimize character profile loading for seamless integration with AI agents.
